        <h2> 1 Introduction </h2>
        <p>
          This project is on developing a mobile manipulator for NUS’s Innovation & Design Hub to relieve staff workload. It integrates mechanical, electrical, and software design to create a unified robot system with a user-friendly GUI control and seamless system integration.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="Intro_11">
        <h3>1.1 Context</h3>
        <p>
          Robots are increasingly used to relieve labour shortages and handle repetitive tasks across sectors like warehousing, healthcare, and hospitality. This is accelerating a shift from factory-only deployment to human-centric environments, with robots taking on point-to-point delivery and routine workflows as seen in Figure 1.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/articles.png"
          subtitle="Fig 1: A collage of articles showing an increasing interest in Warehouse Automation"></image-component>
        <p>
          The team had an interest in knowing where the National University of Singapore can benefit from such a system. To explore this, the team decided to choose the Innovation and Design Hub as the testing ground. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The Hub was chosen as a location of interest as it is one of the largest workspaces within NUS with high student traffic from various disciplines to use the facilities to do discussions, fabrication or tinker. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="Intro_12">
        <h3>1.2 The Innovation and Design Hub</h3>
        <p>
          Before starting any design of the system, the team needed to understand the space and operations within the Hub. 3 distinct areas were noted down from the floor plan in Figure 2, and these are the Tinkering Corner, Sandbox and ILounge. 
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/FloorPlan.png"
          subtitle="Fig 2: Floor Plan of the Hub"></image-component>

      <div id="Intro_121">
        <h3>1.2.1 Tinkering Corner</h3>
        <p>
          The Tinkering Corner (Location in Figure 3) is where staff and students have access to machines to do fabrication such as 3D printing and laser cutting. The space is also utilised for classes and workshops.  
        </p>

      </div>
      <div id="Intro_122">
        <h3>1.2.2 Sandbox</h3>
        <p>
          The Sandbox (Location in Figure 4) is the ‘classroom’ area of the Hub. It is frequently booked for events, classes and workshops. Students also come here to study or have discussions. 
        </p>

        <h3>1.2.3 ILounge</h3>
        <p>
          Like Sandbox, this space is used for classes and discussion amongst students. (Location in Figure 5)

      <div id="PA_21">
        <h3>2.1 Stakeholders</h3>
        <p>
          The project involves the Hub Technical Staff seen in Figure 6, How Yee Teng (primary) and Patrick Tan Shoong Chin (secondary), as well as the Hub Technical Assistants. To gather insights, data collection through surveys and observations helped the team to understand their roles and contributions as well as understanding what problems the staff faced on the ground.

      <div id="PA_22">
        <h3>2.2 User Survey</h3>
        <p>
          User surveys conducted by the team were to collect information such as the taskings that the staff members need to conduct daily, the frequency of each task (Figure 7) and their thoughts on how to improve their current workload.

          Staff report that even single-item pickups disrupt their work: tools are dispersed across the Hub, and requests often arrive mid-task, forcing pauses or delays. Students also pile used items on a table, leaving staff to restock before the 6 pm close, creating a rushed end-of-day.
        </p>

        <p>
          To understand staff workload, we tracked Hub footfall for one month and compiled historical data on major tasks (Figures 8–9). Both series show steady growth in recent months, signaling rising demands without added manpower.

        <p>
          To assist in handling tasks that cannot be handled by software changes due to the physical nature of interaction, a physical solution can be created that will be able to aid the staff in handling work as proposed in the Value Propostion Canvas in Figure 11. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The team will develop an autonomous mobile manipulator that combines navigation and manipulation: it can move through the Hub, pick and handle objects, and deliver them to staff—without requiring constant monitoring or extra devices.

          Based on the derived problem statements and key problems identified by the staff, the design specifications were prepared. Given our limited manpower, budget of $1600 SGD and time for development of less than a year, we decided to scope down to 3 distinct tasks that the system must achieve that assists with the staff.

        <h3>3.2 Design constraints</h3>
        <p>
          To design the robot, design constraints must first be established. The 2 categories of constraints are environmental and system constraints. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="F_321">
        <h4>3.2.1 Environmental Constraints</h4>
        <p>
          To perform Task 1 (Tool Collection) and Task 2 (Point-to-Point Delivery), the robot’s physical size must be appropriate. Constrains on the robot’s dimension are as identified:
        </p>
        <p> 1. Height Constraints:</p>
        <p> The structure must position the Cobot at a suitable height so that its full 910 mm reach can access both the top and bottom sections of the pegboard, as well as the worktable surface as shown in figure 21.</p>
        <p> 2. Width Constraints:</p>
        <p> The robot’s overall footprint must fit within the aisle and workspace clearances shown in figure 21 to allow smooth navigation in the Hub.</p>

      <div id="F_322">
        <h4>3.2.2 System Constraints </h4>
        <p>
          1. Payload Capacity and Stability Constraints:
        </p>
        <p>
          The AMR’s payload limit and stability requirements significantly influences the mechanical design. Figure 23 shows the main payloads on the AMR.
        </p>
        <image-component size="large" tag="image" source="assets/fc/sec 3.2.2 Fig 23.png"
          subtitle="Fig 23: Main payloads of AMR and their Weights"></image-component>
        <p>
          The AMR has a payload capacity of 100kg. After deducting the weight of the payloads in figure 23, 40.9 kg capacity remains. This limited allowance requires the structure to be designed as lightweight as possible to accommodate for contingencies. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from that, the overall CG of payloads must remain within the AMR's designated limits, as illustrated in figure 24 below. To achieve a centralized CG, our components must be arranged in such a way that the weights distributed across the AMR are as even as possible. This is challenging due to the significant variation in payload weights and the need to optimise the AMR’s limited space.
        </p>

        <p>
          2. Functional requirements of robot: 
        </p>
        <p>
          To support the robot’s intended operations, the mechanical structure must accommodate the following features as shown in the figure below. 
        </p>
        <image-component size="medium" tag="image" source="assets/fc/sec 3.2.2 fig25.png"
          subtitle="Fig 25: List of Functional Requirements Robot structure must have"></image-component>
        <p>
          Integrating these functional needs poses a space optimization challenge as there is limited space available on the AMR.

      <div id="F_33">
        <h3>3.3 Payload configuration concept screening</h3>
        <p>
          With the design constraints established, the next portion of the design process involved identifying the optimal payload configuration on the AMR. To do this systematically, the largest and most restrictive component- the controller- was positioned first to define the primary boundaries, after which smaller components were arranged around it. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The figure below shows the 4 main controller orientations explored:
        </p>

          subtitle="Fig 26: Controller orientations explored for design iterations"></image-component>
        <p>
          Based on these orientations, 5 iterations were drafted:

        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/fc/sec 3.3 Fig 27.png"
          subtitle="Fig 27: Iterations of payload configurations"></image-component>
        <p>
          To decide the best design, these iterations were screened through a selection matrix as shown in figure 28. The definitions of the evaluation criteria are as stated in figure 29. To understand the rationale behind the selection process in details, refer to <a href="#Appendix_D">Appendix D1</a>.

          subtitle="Fig 29: Criterion used in selection matrix to evaluate design iterations"></image-component>
        <p>
          From the concept selection matrix, we see that iteration 5 is the best performing configuration. Thus, it will be the chosen design for further development.

        <p>
          The figure below shows a previous frame iteration. This design wasn’t selected as it required more profiles, particularly at the base (highlighted in red in the figure) where it mounts to the AMR. Using more profiles increases tolerance accumulation, making assembly more difficult and raises the risk of structural misalignment. Additionally, this design requires more bolt points. Thus, it wasn't used.

      <div id="F_361">
        <h4>3.6.1 Current AMR payload weight</h4>
        <p>
          As of the current design (excluding the external cover, tool changer unit, and basket), the total payload weight on the AMR is 81.72 kg. Considering a ±5% tolerance, it would be 77.63kg-85.81 kg. To improve accuracy, the actual material properties of heavier components were measured and applied in SolidWorks (See <a href="#Appendix_D">Appendix D2</a>).

        <h4>3.6.2 Stability analysis</h4>
        <p>
          As mentioned in Section 3.2.2, the AMR has defined boundaries that indicate the permissible CG range for its payload. To ensure our design meet this requirement, CG analysis was conducted at three arm positions: Default, fully forward, and fully sideways. In all cases, the CG remained within the allowable limits.

        <h4>3.6.3 Structural strength analysis</h4>
        <p>
          Static simulation was done to ensure that the frame and Cobot mounting plate is strong enough to withstand the heavy weight of the Cobot. From the figure below, we can see that the structure is well below it’s yield strength. Explanation for how analysis was done can be found in <a href="#Appendix_D">Appendix D3</a>. Apart from yield strength, we also analysed other aspects such as Factor of safety. See <a href="#Appendix_D">Appendix D4</a> for more information.

        <p>
          As the robot is stable at its extreme arm positions in the CG analysis, and static loading tests indicate the structure is strong, we know that it will also remain stable under dynamic conditions, particularly since both the Cobot and AMR will be operated at conservative speeds for safety reasons.

          To design the End Effectors for the system, design constraints must be established in terms of the actuation mode of choice, overall maximum size and the maximum mass before further analysis on the approach can be done. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="EE-41">
        <h3>4.1 Actuation mode</h3>
        <p>
          To narrow down the ideal Actuation mode for the system, we evaluated the main types of actuation methods against various criteria for the system through the Concept Screening technique seen in Figure 44.
        </p>

          subtitle="Fig 44: Actuation mode concept screening"></image-component>
          <p>
          Given the AMR’s payload limits and internal space constraints, hardware requirements received higher weight. Based on the concept screening and system needs, electric actuation was selected for the end effector.

        <h3>4.2 Size and Mass Constraints</h3>
        <p>
          The size and mass constraints of the system are decided by the following factors:
        </p>
        <p>
          Cobot End Effector Payload Capacity: 5kg
        </p>
        <p>
          Ideal end effector centre of gravity: Within 135mm from the end connection of J6, max width of 200mm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Allocated space on the robot structure: 600mm x 135mm x 200mm (See Figure 45)

        <p>
          Given the task requirements, one end effector must pick tools from the pegboard, shown in Figure 46. Tool size and mass were measured to define the end effector’s design requirements as shown in Figure 47.

        <h4>4.3.1 Design challenges</h4>
        <p>
          The clamping interface must secure tools with varied, non-linear surfaces and materials (plastic, rubber, steel) whose friction affects required clamping force. Because approach angles may be imperfect, the gripper must tolerate misalignment from positional error without dropping the tool. (Figure 48)

        <h3>4.4 End Effector Design</h3>

          With the design constraints known, design specifications for both the gripper and tool changer unit are specified.(Figure 49)

        <h3>4.5 Grippers</h3>
        <p>
          To choose the ideal gripper mechanisms, the team used a concept screening chart to evaluate different designs against key metrics shown in Figure 50.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/grippercc.png"
          subtitle="Fig 50: Gripper concept selection"></image-component>
        <p>
          Based on the metric scoring, the rack and pinion and lead screw approach were both chosen to further prototype and explore.
        </p>
        <p>
          To handle misalignment and limit contact pressure on curved surfaces, we explored compliant fingers—specifically the Festo Fin Ray design (Figure 51). Its flexible, fin-like ribbed structure passively wraps around objects, redirecting contact forces into closing forces rather than peeling. The result is gentle, adaptive gripping of irregular or fragile parts, high misalignment tolerance, and simpler actuation/control than rigid parallel jaws.

        <h3>4.6 Tool Changers</h3>
        <p>
          As the system will be interacting with various tools, a singular gripper design may be unable to carry or support all types of objects. As a result, the team aims to implement a tool changing system onboard the Cobot to facilitate end-effector changes. Due to the actuation mode being limited to being electric, the team narrowed down 3 concepts that can be explored and evaluated those against metricsa as seen in Figure 52.
        </p>
        <image-component size = "large" tag="image" source="assets/toolcc.png"
          subtitle="Fig 52: Tool Changer concept selection"></image-component>
        <p>
          Due to the limited space and mass constraints on the system, the Compactness/Weight criterion was weighted highly. Based on the scoring, the Permanent Electromagnet was chosen to be the concept to be explored further.

      <div id="EE-471">
        <h4>4.7.1 Gripper</h4>
        <p>
          Before analysis can be done, an approximate normal force acting on the gripper jaw was established at 10N based on supporting a load of 15N with rubber contact against metal at a coefficient of friction of 0.69. <a href="#Appendix_E">(Refer to Appendix E2 and E3)</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          To test the Fin Ray design, an inspired gripper was designed and simulated it in SolidWorks via Nonlinear analysis, using TPU-85A as the material. The goal of the analysis was to locate the ideal gripping section that will allow the gripper to wrap around the object as seen in Figure 53. The full analysis can be seen in <a href="#Appendix_E">Appendix E4.</a>

        </p>
        <p>
          The electromagnet used was a permanent electromagnet with a 24V demagnetisation (release) input with 30kg rated strength. For the magnetic material, S275 Ferritic Steel was chosen with 6mm thickness to improve flux and holding force. (Figure 56)

        <h2>5 Electrical Subsystem - Electrical Integration (Fang Chen)</h2>
        <p>
          The scope of this subsystem is to design and implement the circuitry used to integrate AMR and Cobot together.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="ES-51">
        <h3>5.1 AMR and Cobot integrated circuit</h3>
        <p>
          The system load can be classified into 2 categories: peripheral devices (PC, router, etc.) and the Cobot controller.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ideally, all electronics would be powered directly from the AMR. However, the controller requires up to 1 kVA during continuous operation, while the AMR can only supply 960W (48V, 20A max), which is insufficient. To address this, a 72 V battery with a capacity of 1152 Wh was introduced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Figure 57 shows the initial circuit design, where all loads were powered solely by the battery. This configuration was later revised as the battery runtime is limited. To extend system operating time and optimize power usage, the peripheral devices were powered by the AMR instead, reducing the load on the battery. The finalized circuit design is shown in Figure 58.
        </p>
        <image-component  tag="image" source="assets/fc/sec 5.1 fig 48.png"

          <image-component  tag="image" source="assets/fc/sec 5.1 figure 49.png"
          subtitle="Fig 58: Final Circuit Design"></image-component>
        <p>
          In the final circuit, the AMR’s 48 V is stepped down to 5 V, 9 V, 12 V, and 24 V to power the peripheral devices. Since the controller operates on AC power, the 72 VDC from the battery is converted to AC through a power inverter. This is the current circuitry on our robot. Additional loads such as tool changer, and other peripherals are to be incorporated later in the project. Battery runtime calculations comparing the initial and final circuit designs are provided in <a href="#Appendix_F">Appendix F1</a>

        <p>
          Both the AMR and cobot include collision safeguards as shown in Figure 67. The software system interlocks their motion, cobot commands are sent only when the AMR is stationary, and vice versa. During cobot operation, an ellipsoidal “protective bubble” enforces a safe zone; any trajectory that breaches it is terminated immediately.

        <h4>6.3.2 Cobot Trajectory Planner</h4>
        <p>
          For the Cobot to reach a desired position in space, a positional command made of Vectors and Quaternions must be sent to establish both relative position and orientation, which is called a “frame”. To move between 2 frames with a specified trajectory and constraints would require a trajectory planner. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Custom planner development was out of scope, so we used MoveIt2 planners compatible with the cobot driver: OMPL, CHOMP, and PILZ. We evaluated them for our use case and compared their performance across key metrics (See Figure 68).

          subtitle="Fig 68: Selection of ideal trajectory planner for Cobot"></image-component>
        <p>
          We scored planners 1–3 (3 = best), penalizing stochastic/unpredictable behavior and heavy compute. PILZ ranked highest because it deterministically picks the shortest feasible path, respects velocity limits, and delivers repeatable, predictable motion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The planner was defined for use in the test_rv5as.py node such that any input commands will move the robot system accordingly.
