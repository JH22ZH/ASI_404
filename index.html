        <h2> 1. Introduction </h2>
        <p>
          This project is on developing a mobile manipulator for NUS’s Innovation & Design Hub to relieve staff workload. It integrates mechanical, electrical, and software design to create a unified robot system with a user-friendly GUI control and seamless system integration.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="Intro_11">
        <h3>1.1 Context</h3>
        <p>
          Robots are increasingly used to relieve labour shortages and handle repetitive tasks across sectors like warehousing, healthcare, and hospitality. This is accelerating a shift from factory-only deployment to human-centric environments, with robots taking on point-to-point delivery and routine workflows as seen in Fig 1.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/articles.png"
          subtitle="Fig 1: A collage of articles showing an increasing interest in Warehouse Automation"></image-component>
        <p>
          The team had an interest in knowing where the National University of Singapore benefit can from such a system. To explore this, the team decided to choose the Innovation and Design Hub as the testing ground. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The Hub was chosen as a location of interest as it is one of the largest workspaces within NUS with high student traffic from various disciplines to use the facilities to do discussions, fabrication or tinker. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="Intro_12">
        <h3>1.2 The Innovation and Design Hub</h3>
        <p>
          Before starting any design of the system, the team needed to understand the space and operations within the Hub. 3 distinct areas were noted down, and these are the Tinkering Corner, Sandbox and ILounge. 
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/FloorPlan.png"
          subtitle="Fig 2: Floor Plan of the Hub"></image-component>

      <div id="Intro_121">
        <h3>1.2.1 Tinkering Corner</h3>
        <p>
          The Tinkering Corner is where staff and students have access to machines to do fabrication such as 3D printing and laser cutting. The space is also utilised for classes and workshops. 
        </p>

        <!-- This is an example of how you might use the image component -->

      </div>
      <div id="Intro_122">
        <h3>1.2.2 Sandbox</h3>
        <p>
          The Sandbox is the ‘classroom’ area of the Hub. It is frequently booked for events, classes and workshops. Students also come here to study or have discussions. 
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/Sandbox.png"
          subtitle="Fig 4: Floor Plan of the Hub"></image-component>

      <div id="Intro_123">
        <h3>1.2.3 ILounge</h3>
        <p>
          Like Sandbox, this space is used for classes and discussion amongst students. 
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/ILounge.png"

        <h2> 2. Problem Analysis</h2>
      </div>

      <div id="PA_21">
        <h3>2.1 Stakeholders</h3>
        <p>
          The project involves the Hub Technical Staff see in Figure 6, How Yee Teng (primary) and Patrick Tan Shoong Chin (secondary), as well as the Hub Technical Assistants. To gather insights, data collection through surveys and observations helped the team to understand their roles and contributions as well as understanding what problems the staff faced on the ground. 
        </p>
        <image-component size="large" tag="image" source="assets/idpstaff.png"
          subtitle="Fig 6: IDP Staff Members"></image-component>
      </div>

      <div id="PA_22">
        <h3>2.2 User Survey</h3>
        <p>
          User surveys conducted by the team were to collect information such as the taskings that the staff members need to conduct daily, the frequency of each task (Seen in Figure 7) and their thoughts on how to improve their current workload.
        </p>
        <image-component size="large" tag="image" source="assets/UserSurvey.png"
          subtitle="Fig 7: User Survey on tasks done"></image-component>

        <p>
          Staff report that even single-item pickups disrupt their work: tools are dispersed across the Hub, and requests often arrive mid-task, forcing pauses or delays. Students also pile used items on a table, leaving staff to restock before the 6 pm close, creating a rushed end-of-day.
        </p>

        <p>
          To understand staff workload, we tracked Hub footfall for one month and compiled historical data on major tasks (Figures 8–9). Both series show steady growth in recent months, signaling rising demands without added manpower.
        </p>

        <p>
          Staff surveys and observations show a consistent strain in balancing time-critical tasks with student support. Accordingly, we framed a problem statement that captures these operational challenges faced by Hub staff.

        <h3>2.4 Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>
          Several redundant tasks are slowing down the work of the Hub Staff and reducing efficiency in the Hub during the school semester. There is a need to streamline or automate these tasks.

        <p>
          To assist in handling tasks that cannot be handled by software changes due to the physical nature of interaction, a physical solution can be created that will be able to aid the staff in handling work. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The team will develop an autonomous mobile manipulator that combines navigation and manipulation: it can move through the Hub, pick and handle objects, and deliver them to staff—without requiring constant monitoring or extra devices.

        <h3>2.7 Design Specifications</h3>
        <p>
          Based on the derived problem statements and key problems identified by the staff, the design specifications were prepared. Given our limited manpower, budget of $1600 SGD and time for development of less than a year, we decided to scope down to 3 distinct tasks that the system must achieve that assists with the staff.
        </p>
        <p>
          Task 1.	The system must be able to perform tool collection  
        </p>
         <p>
          Task 2.	The system must be capable of point-to-point delivery 
        </p>
         <p>
          Task 3.	To supplement controls to the system, a user interface must be created

        <p>
          For task 1, the robot is to grab tools from the pegboard, put it into an onboard basket and deliver it to a table. End-effector system with tool changer capabilities enables picking tools of different geometries.

        <h3>3.2. Design constraints</h3>
        <p>
          To design the robot, design constraints must first be established. The 2 categories of constraints are environmental and system constraints. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="F_321">
        <h3>3.2.1. Environmental Constraints</h3>
        <p>
          To perform Task 1 (Tool Collection) and Task 2 (Point-to-Point Delivery), the robot’s physical size must be appropriate. Constrains on the robot’s dimension are as identified:
        </p>
        <p> 1. Height Constraints:</p>
        <p> The structure must position the Cobot at a suitable height so that its full 910 mm reach can access both the top and bottom sections of the pegboard, as well as the worktable surface as shown in figure 21.</p>
        <p> 2. Width Constraints:</p>
        <p> The robot’s overall footprint must fit within the aisle and workspace clearances shown in figure 21 to allow smooth navigation in the Hub.</p>

        <h3>3.2.2 System Constraints </h3>
        <p>
          1. Payload Capacity and Stability Constraints:
        </p>
        <p>
          The AMR’s payload limit and stability requirements significantly influences the mechanical design. Figure 23 shows the main payloads on the AMR.
        </p>
        <image-component size="large" tag="image" source="assets/fc/sec 3.2.2 Fig 23.png"
          subtitle="Fig 23: Main payloads of AMR and their Weights"></image-component>
        <p>
          The AMR has a payload capacity of 100kg. After deducting the weight of the payloads in figure 23, 40.9 kg capacity remains. This limited allowance requires the structure to be designed as lightweight as possible to accommodate for contingencies. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from that, the overall CG of payloads must remain within the AMR's designated limits, as illustrated in figure 24 below. To achieve a centralized CG, our components must be arranged in such a way that the weights distributed across the AMR are as even as possible. This is challenging due to the significant variation in payload weights and the need to optimise the AMR’s limited space.
        </p>

        <p>
          2. Functional requirements of robot: 
        </p>
        <p>
          To support the robot’s intended operations, the mechanical structure must accommodate the following features as shown in the figure below. 
        </p>

          subtitle="Fig 25: List of Functional Requirements Robot structure must have"></image-component>
        <p>
          Integrating these functional needs poses a space optimization challenge as there is limited space available on the AMR.

      </div>

      <div id="F_33">
        <h3>3.3. Payload configuration concept screening</h3>
        <p>
          With the design constraints established, the next portion of the design process involved identifying the optimal payload configuration on the AMR. To do this systematically, the largest and most restrictive component- the controller- was positioned first to define the primary boundaries, after which smaller components were arranged around it. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The figure below shows the 4 main controller orientations explored:

        <p>
          Based on these orientations, 5 iterations were drafted:

          subtitle="Fig 27: Iterations of payload configurations"></image-component>
        <p>
          To decide the best design, these iterations were screened through a selection matrix as shown in figure 28. The definitions of the evaluation criteria are as stated in figure 29. To understand the rationale behind the selection process in details, refer to Appendix D1.  
        </p>

          subtitle="Fig 29: Criterion used in selection matrix to evaluate design iterations"></image-component>
        <p>
          From the concept selection matrix, we see that iteration 5 is the best performing configuration. Thus, it will be the chosen design for further development.

          The figure below shows a previous frame iteration. This design wasn’t selected as it required more profiles, particularly at the base (highlighted in red in the figure) where it mounts to the AMR. Using more profiles increases tolerance accumulation, making assembly more difficult and raises the risk of structural misalignment. Additionally, this design requires more bolt points. Thus, it wasn't used.

          As of the current design (excluding the external cover, tool changer unit, and basket), the total payload weight on the AMR is 81.72 kg. Considering a ±5% tolerance, it would be 77.63kg-85.81 kg. To improve accuracy, the actual material properties of heavier components were measured and applied in SolidWorks (See Appendix D2).

        <p>
          As mentioned in Section 3.2.2, the AMR has defined boundaries that indicate the permissible CG range for its payload. To ensure our design meet this requirement, CG analysis was conducted at three arm positions: Default, fully forward, and fully sideways. In all cases, the CG remained within the allowable limits.

        <h3>3.6.3 Structural strength analysis</h3>
        <p>
          Static simulation was done to ensure that the frame and Cobot mounting plate is strong enough to withstand the heavy weight of the Cobot. From the figure below, we can see that the structure is well below it’s yield strength. Explanation for how analysis was done can be found in Appendix D3. Apart from yield strength, we also analysed other aspects such as Factor of safety and Resultant displacement. See Appendix D4 for more information.

        <p>
          As the robot is stable at its extreme arm positions in the CG analysis, and static loading tests indicate the structure is strong, we know that it will also remain stable under dynamic conditions, particularly since both the Cobot and AMR will be operated at conservative speeds for safety reasons.

        <h4>4.3.1 Design challenges</h4>
        <p>
          Between the various tools, the clamping interface must securely hold varying non-linear surfaces, with material contact surfaces varying across tools (plastic, rubber, steel), each having a different coefficient of friction which impacts the clamping force. Misalignment during gripping is also a concern, as the robot may not always approach the tool at an ideal angle due to positional inaccuracies. The gripper must accommodate these misalignments without dropping the tool.

        <h3>4.5 Grippers</h3>
        <p>
          To choose the ideal gripper mechanisms, the team used a concept screening chart to evaluate different designs against key metrics.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/grippercc.png"
          subtitle="Fig 4: Gripper concept selection"></image-component>
        <p>
          Based on the metric scoring, the rack and pinion and lead screw approach were both chosen to further prototype and explore.
        </p>
        <p>
          To account for misalignment and excessive contact pressure on non-linear surfaces, I decided to investigate compliant gripper fingers. A common design used is the Festo Fin Ray gripper finger design. The Festo Fin Ray gripper uses a flexible, fin-like triangular skeleton with transverse ribs that passively bends around objects, so contact forces redirect into closing forces instead of peeling them away. This geometry gives gentle, adaptive gripping of irregular or fragile parts, high tolerance to misalignment, and simpler actuation/control compared with rigid parallel jaws.

        <h3>4.6 Tool Changers</h3>
        <p>
          As the system will be interacting with various tools, a singular gripper design may be unable to carry or support all types of objects. As a result, the team aims to implement a tool changing system onboard the Cobot to facilitate end-effector changes. Due to the actuation mode being limited to being electric, the team narrowed down 3 concepts that can be explored and evaluated those against metrics.

          subtitle="Fig 4: Tool Changer concept selection"></image-component>

          Due to the limited space and mass constraints on the system, the Compactness/Weight criterion was weighted highly. Based on the scoring, the Permanent Electromagnet was chosen to be the concept to be explored further.

        <h4>4.7.1 Gripper</h4>
        <p>
          Before analysis can be done, an approximate normal force acting on the gripper jaw was established at 10N based on supporting a load of 15N with rubber contact against metal at a coefficient of friction of 0.69. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To test the Fin Ray design, an inspired gripper was designed and simulated it in SolidWorks via Nonlinear analysis, using TPU-85A as the material. The goal of the analysis was to locate the ideal gripping section that will allow the gripper to wrap around the object.

        <p>
          To test the Rack and Pinion concept with the Fin Ray gripper fingers, I built a 3D-printed prototype using PLA with TPU-85A for the fingers to test the deformation and gripping strength.

          To test the permanent electromagnet concept, calculations were performed on the type of electromagnet used, the corresponding magnetic material to maximise the magnetic attraction between the magnet and electromagnet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The electromagnet use was a permanent electromagnet with a 24V demagnetisation input with 30kg rated strength. For the magnetic material, S275 Ferritic Steel was chosen with 6mm thickness to maximise the magnetic field.
        </p>
        <p>
          Current tests indicate that the magnet can sustain 10kgs of load for a sustained period. Future works into the next semester will focus on creating the tool changer system with the mechanical body and electrical connections.

        <h2>5. Electrical Subsystem - Electrical Integration (Fang Chen)</h2>
        <p>
          The scope of this subsystem is to design and implement the circuitry used to integrate AMR and Cobot together.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="ES-51">
        <h3>5.1. AMR and Cobot integrated circuit</h3>
        <p>
          The system load can be classified into 2 categories: peripheral devices (PC, router, etc.) and the Cobot controller.<a href="#image">Link to the image above</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Ideally, all electronics would be powered directly from the AMR. However, the controller requires up to 1 kVA during continuous operation, while the AMR can only supply 960W (48V, 20A max), which is insufficient. To address this, a 72 V battery with a capacity of 1152 Wh was introduced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Figure 48 shows the initial circuit design, where all loads were powered solely by the battery. This configuration was later revised as the battery runtime is limited. To extend system operating time and optimize power usage, the peripheral devices were powered by the AMR instead, reducing the load on the battery. The finalized circuit design is shown in Figure 49.
        </p>
        <image-component  tag="image" source="assets/fc/sec 5.1 fig 48.png"

          subtitle="Placeholder"></image-component>
        <p>
          In the final circuit, the AMR’s 48 V is stepped down to 5 V, 9 V, 12 V, and 24 V to power the peripheral devices. Since the controller operates on AC power, the 72 VDC from the battery is converted to AC through a power inverter. Battery runtime calculation comparing initial and final circuit design is in Appendix F1.

          Between the AMR and Cobot, there are several safety features in place to protect the user in the event of a collision. To add on to monitoring these peripherals, the software system will send movement commands only if the AMR is stationary and vice versa.

        <h4>6.3.2 Cobot Trajectory Planner</h4>
        <p>
          For the Cobot to reach a desired position in space, a positional command made of Vectors and Quaternions must be sent to establish both relative position and orientation, which is called a “frame”. To move between 2 frames with a specified trajectory and constraints would require a trajectory planner. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Since developing a planner was not in the scope of the project, the team opted to use planners available in the MoveIt2 Library with ROS2 to fit the Cobot. There are different planners, each with their own advantages. 3 planners were chosen based on the Cobot ROS2 driver compatibility. These are OMPL (Open Motion Planning Library), CHOMP (Covariant Hamiltonian Optimization for Motion Planning) and PILZ (PILZ Industrial Motion Planner). We cross-compared the planners with our use case based on metrics seen in the table below.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/plannerscoring.png"
          subtitle="Figure x: Selection of ideal trajectory planner for Cobot"></image-component>
        <p>
          For scoring, we scored it from 1 – 3, with 3 being ideal. Due to the conditions that the robot system must interact with, planners with unpredictable behaviour or have probability-based planning were rated lower. Planners with high computational requirement were also rated low. PILZ ended up being the most ideal planner for our use case as it chooses the shortest path while following velocity constraints with high repeatability and predictability.  
        </p>
        <p>
          The planner was defined for use in the test_rv5as.py node such that any input commands will move the robot system accordingly.

          Based on Task 3, a user interface is to be created to allow the stakeholders to send requests to the system to perform tasks. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Although both the AMR and Cobot have their own respective GUIs for control, to create a unified robot system would mean a singular user interface that allows for control of both systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our final GUI vision is a single, unified interface that controls both the Cobot and the AMR. Built for staff and makers, it enables task execution without any coding, using clear workflows and teach-by-demonstration tools. A dedicated teaching mode streamlines adding goals and waypoints, making everyday operation fast and intuitive.
