        <h2> 1. Introduction </h2>
        <p>
          This project aims to develop a Mobile Manipulator for use in the Innovation and Design Hub within NUS, with the system being purpose-built to assist and provide value to the staff stationed in the Hub for task alleviation. This approach is multi-disciplinary in nature, aiming at the mechanical, electrical and software design of the mobile manipulator to facilitate easier modification for tooling, a more user-friendly abstraction layer to code the robot to perform tasks and overall software integration.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-1">
        <h3>1.1 Context</h3>
        <p>
          Robots are increasingly used to relieve labour shortages and handle repetitive tasks across sectors like warehousing, healthcare, and hospitality. This is accelerating a shift from factory-only deployment to human-centric environments, with robots taking on point-to-point delivery and routine workflows.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/articles.png"
          subtitle="Fig 1: A collage of articles showing an increasing interest in Warehouse Automation"></image-component>
        <p>
          The team had an interest in knowing where the National University of Singapore benefit can from such a system. To explore this, the team decided to choose the Innovation and Design Hub as the testing ground. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The Hub was chosen as a location of interest as it is one of the largest workspaces within NUS with high student traffic from various disciplines to use the facilities to do discussions, fabrication or tinker. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-2">
        <h3>1.2 The Innovation and Design Hub</h3>
        <p>
          Before starting any design of the system, the team needed to understand the space and operations within the Hub. 3 distinct areas were noted down, and these are the Tinkering Corner, Sandbox and ILounge. 
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/FloorPlan.png"
          subtitle="Fig 2: Floor Plan of the Hub"></image-component>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-3">
        <h3>1.2.1 Tinkering Corner</h3>
        <p>
          The Tinkering Corner is where staff and students have access to machines to do fabrication such as 3D printing and laser cutting. The space is also utilised for classes and workshops. 
        </p>

      </div>
      <div id="sub-section-1-header-4">
        <h3>1.2.2 Sandbox</h3>
        <p>
          The Sandbox is the ‘classroom’ area of the Hub. It is frequently booked for events, classes and workshops. Students also come here to study or have discussions. 
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/Sandbox.png"
          subtitle="Fig 4: Floor Plan of the Hub"></image-component>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-5">
        <h3>1.2.3 ILounge</h3>
        <p>
          Like Sandbox, this space is used for classes and discussion amongst students. 
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/ILounge.png"
          subtitle="Fig 4: Floor Plan of the Hub"></image-component>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-6">
        <h3>1.3 Stakeholders</h3>
        <p>
          The project involves the IDP Technical Staff, How Yee Teng (primary) and Patrick Tan Shoong Chin (secondary), as well as the IDP Technical Assistants. To gather insights, data collection through surveys and observations helped the team to understand their roles and contributions as well as understanding what problems the staff faced on the ground. 
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/Nulle.png"

      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-7">
        <h3>1.4 User Survey</h3>
        <p>
          User surveys conducted by the team were to collect information such as the taskings that the staff members need to conduct daily, the frequency of each task and their thoughts on how to improve their current workload. 
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/UserSurvey.png"
          subtitle="Fig 5: User Survey on tasks done"></image-component>

        <p>
          Additional info from the staff mentioned that even a single-item pickup is disruptive: components and tools are scattered across the Hub, and requests often arrive while they’re busy, forcing them to pause their work or make students wait. They also noted that students leave used items piled on a table for staff to sort and restock before the 6 pm close, creating a rushed end-of-day process. 
        </p>

        <p>
          To gain further insights into the work that the staff need to handle, we observed the daily footfall of the Hub’s space for the span of a month alongside gathering historical data of other major work that the staff must handle. 
        </p>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-8">
        <h3>1.5 Problem description</h3>
        <p>
          To ascertain the problems further, we drafted up a problem identification table utilising the 5W1H template. 
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/5W1h.png"
          subtitle="Fig 4: Problem Identification"></image-component>
        
        <p>
          Staff surveys and observations show a consistent strain in balancing time-critical tasks with student support. Accordingly, we framed a problem statement that captures these operational challenges faced by Hub staff.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-9">
        <h3>1.6 Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>
          Several redundant tasks are slowing down the work of the Hub Staff and reducing efficiency in the Hub during the school semester. There is a need to streamline or automate these tasks.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-10">
        <h3>1.7 Design Statement</h3>
        <p>
          To build a system that is mobile, to travel around the Hub’s environment, can manipulate and interact with the Hub’s objects and is autonomous, the staff do not need to act as a middleman
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-10">
        <h3>1.8 Value Proposition</h3>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/vpc.png"
          subtitle="Fig 4: Problem Identification"></image-component>
        <p>
          To assist in handling tasks that cannot be handled by software changes due to the physical nature of interaction, a physical solution can be created that will be able to aid the staff in handling work. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This project will develop a robot that is under the “Mobile Manipulator” classification that has both traversal and mobile capabilities. This Mobile Manipulator will be able to travel around the Hub’s space with capabilities to interact and manipulate objects to deliver to the Staff. To control all this, the system must be autonomous to not burden the staff with another device they need to monitor constantly. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-11">
        <h3>1.9 Design Specifications</h3>
        <p>
          Based on the derived problem statements and key problems identified by the staff, the design specifications were prepared. Given our limited manpower, budget of $1600 SGD and time for development of less than a year, we decided to scope down to 3 distinct tasks that the system must achieve that assists with the staff.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.	The system must be able to perform tool collection  
        </p>
         <p>
          2.	The system must be capable of point-to-point delivery 
        </p>
         <p>
          3.	To supplement controls to the system, a user interface must be created 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-12">
        <h3>1.9.1 Task 1: Tool Collection</h3>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/ploc.png"
          subtitle="Fig 4: Problem Identification"></image-component>
        <p>
          For task 1, the robot is to grab tools from the pegboard, put it into an onboard basket and deliver it to a table. End-effector system with tool changer capabilities enables picking tools of different geometries.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-13">
        <h3>1.9.2 Task 2: Point - to - point delivery</h3>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/delRoute.png"
          subtitle="Fig 4: Problem Identification"></image-component>
        <p>
          For task 2, the robot is to travel to the storeroom where several components are located to return items that the students have borrowed throughout the day. The onboard basket can be detached from the system to return items as a set. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-14">
        <h3>1.9.2 Task 3: User Interface</h3>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/task3.png"
          subtitle="Fig 4: Problem Identification"></image-component>
        <p>
          For task 3, for the staff to control and monitor signs onboard for the system to function, a user interface is to create that can link commands from the user to the relevant commands for the hardware to perform the task.  
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-15">
        <h3>1.10.0 Concept Development</h3>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/condev.png"
          subtitle="Fig 4: Problem Identification"></image-component>
        <p>
          To evaluate the ideal concepts for development, we cross compared various concepts that fulfil the tasks across various metrics such as hardware complexity, cost, scalability etc. At the end, the traditional mobile manipulator is the ideal choice as there is a high degree of flexibility in changing out end-effectors for the system, it can adapt to the environment and is statically stable even during power loss or in emergency scenarios.
