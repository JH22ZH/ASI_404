        <h2> 1. Introduction </h2>
        <p>
          This project aims to develop a Mobile Manipulator for use in the Innovation and Design Hub within NUS, with the system being purpose-built to assist and provide value to the staff stationed in the Hub for task alleviation. This approach is multi-disciplinary in nature, aiming at the mechanical, electrical and software design of the mobile manipulator to facilitate easier modification for tooling, a more user-friendly abstraction layer to code the robot to perform tasks and overall software integration.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-1">
        <h3>1.1 Context</h3>
        <p>
          Robots are increasingly used to relieve labour shortages and handle repetitive tasks across sectors like warehousing, healthcare, and hospitality. This is accelerating a shift from factory-only deployment to human-centric environments, with robots taking on point-to-point delivery and routine workflows.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/articles.png"
          subtitle="Fig 1: A collage of articles showing an increasing interest in Warehouse Automation"></image-component>
        <p>
          The team had an interest in knowing where the National University of Singapore benefit can from such a system. To explore this, the team decided to choose the Innovation and Design Hub as the testing ground. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The Hub was chosen as a location of interest as it is one of the largest workspaces within NUS with high student traffic from various disciplines to use the facilities to do discussions, fabrication or tinker. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-2">
        <h3>1.2 The Innovation and Design Hub</h3>
        <p>
          Before starting any design of the system, the team needed to understand the space and operations within the Hub. 3 distinct areas were noted down, and these are the Tinkering Corner, Sandbox and ILounge. 
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/FloorPlan.png"
          subtitle="Fig 2: Floor Plan of the Hub"></image-component>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-3">
        <h3>1.2.1 Tinkering Corner</h3>
        <p>
          The Tinkering Corner is where staff and students have access to machines to do fabrication such as 3D printing and laser cutting. The space is also utilised for classes and workshops. 
        </p>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-4">
        <h3>1.2.2 Sandbox</h3>
        <p>
          The Sandbox is the ‘classroom’ area of the Hub. It is frequently booked for events, classes and workshops. Students also come here to study or have discussions. 
        </p>

        <h3>1.2.3 ILounge</h3>
        <p>
          Like Sandbox, this space is used for classes and discussion amongst students.

        <h2> 2. Problem Analysis</h2>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-6">
        <h3>2.1 Stakeholders</h3>
        <p>
          The project involves the IDP Technical Staff, How Yee Teng (primary) and Patrick Tan Shoong Chin (secondary), as well as the IDP Technical Assistants. To gather insights, data collection through surveys and observations helped the team to understand their roles and contributions as well as understanding what problems the staff faced on the ground. 
        </p>
        <image-component size="large" tag="image" source="assets/idpstaff.png"
          subtitle="Fig 4: IDP Staff Members"></image-component>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-7">
        <h3>2.2 User Survey</h3>
        <p>
          User surveys conducted by the team were to collect information such as the taskings that the staff members need to conduct daily, the frequency of each task and their thoughts on how to improve their current workload. 
        </p>
        <image-component size="large" tag="image" source="assets/UserSurvey.png"
          subtitle="Fig 5: User Survey on tasks done"></image-component>

        <p>
          Additional info from the staff mentioned that even a single-item pickup is disruptive: components and tools are scattered across the Hub, and requests often arrive while they’re busy, forcing them to pause their work or make students wait. They also noted that students leave used items piled on a table for staff to sort and restock before the 6 pm close, creating a rushed end-of-day process. 
        </p>

        <p>
          To gain further insights into the work that the staff need to handle, we observed the daily footfall of the Hub’s space for the span of a month alongside gathering historical data of other major work that the staff must handle. 
        </p>
        <image-component size="large" tag="image" source="assets/Avgfootfall.png"
          subtitle="Fig 6: Average daily footfall of the Hub from opening to closing"></image-component>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/graphs.png"
          subtitle="Fig 7: Graphs showing the rise in both bookings and fabrication hours that the staff must handle."></image-component>

      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-8">
        <h3>2.3 Problem description</h3>
        <p>
          To ascertain the problems further, we drafted up a problem identification table utilising the 5W1H template. 
        </p>
        <image-component size="large" tag="image" source="assets/5W1h.png"
          subtitle="Fig 4: Problem Identification"></image-component>
        
        <p>
          Staff surveys and observations show a consistent strain in balancing time-critical tasks with student support. Accordingly, we framed a problem statement that captures these operational challenges faced by Hub staff.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-9">
        <h3>2.4 Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>
          Several redundant tasks are slowing down the work of the Hub Staff and reducing efficiency in the Hub during the school semester. There is a need to streamline or automate these tasks.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-10">
        <h3>2.5 Design Statement</h3>
        <p>
          To build a system that is mobile, to travel around the Hub’s environment, can manipulate and interact with the Hub’s objects and is autonomous, the staff do not need to act as a middleman
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-10">
        <h3>2.6 Value Proposition</h3>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/vpc.png"
          subtitle="Fig 4: Problem Identification"></image-component>
        <p>
          To assist in handling tasks that cannot be handled by software changes due to the physical nature of interaction, a physical solution can be created that will be able to aid the staff in handling work. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This project will develop a robot that is under the “Mobile Manipulator” classification that has both traversal and mobile capabilities. This Mobile Manipulator will be able to travel around the Hub’s space with capabilities to interact and manipulate objects to deliver to the Staff. To control all this, the system must be autonomous to not burden the staff with another device they need to monitor constantly. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-11">
        <h3>2.7 Design Specifications</h3>
        <p>
          Based on the derived problem statements and key problems identified by the staff, the design specifications were prepared. Given our limited manpower, budget of $1600 SGD and time for development of less than a year, we decided to scope down to 3 distinct tasks that the system must achieve that assists with the staff.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.	The system must be able to perform tool collection  
        </p>
         <p>
          2.	The system must be capable of point-to-point delivery 
        </p>
         <p>
          3.	To supplement controls to the system, a user interface must be created 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-12">
        <h3>2.7.1 Task 1: Tool Collection</h3>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/ploc.png"
          subtitle="Fig 4: Problem Identification"></image-component>
        <p>
          For task 1, the robot is to grab tools from the pegboard, put it into an onboard basket and deliver it to a table. End-effector system with tool changer capabilities enables picking tools of different geometries.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-13">
        <h3>2.7.2 Task 2: Point - to - point delivery</h3>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/delRoute.png"
          subtitle="Fig 4: Problem Identification"></image-component>
        <p>
          For task 2, the robot is to travel to the storeroom where several components are located to return items that the students have borrowed throughout the day. The onboard basket can be detached from the system to return items as a set. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-14">
        <h3>2.7.3 Task 3: User Interface</h3>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/task3.png"
          subtitle="Fig 4: Problem Identification"></image-component>
        <p>
          For task 3, for the staff to control and monitor signs onboard for the system to function, a user interface is to create that can link commands from the user to the relevant commands for the hardware to perform the task.  
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-15">
        <h3>2.8.0 Concept Development</h3>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/condev.png"
          subtitle="Fig 4: Problem Identification"></image-component>
        <p>
          To evaluate the ideal concepts for development, we cross compared various concepts that fulfil the tasks across various metrics such as hardware complexity, cost, scalability etc. At the end, the traditional mobile manipulator is the ideal choice as there is a high degree of flexibility in changing out end-effectors for the system, it can adapt to the environment and is statically stable even during power loss or in emergency scenarios.

        <p>
          Between the various tools, the clamping interface must securely hold varying non-linear surfaces, with material contact surfaces varying across tools (plastic, rubber, steel), each having a different coefficient of friction which impacts the clamping force.

        <h3>3.5 Grippers</h3>
        <p>
          To choose the ideal gripper mechanisms, the team used a concept screening chart to evaluate different designs against key metrics.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/grippercc.png"
          subtitle="Fig 4: Subsystems Part 1"></image-component>
        <p>
          Based on the metric scoring, the rack and pinion and lead screw approach were both chosen to further prototype and explore.
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid excessive contact forces onto a singular contact point, the team decided to investigate compliant gripper fingers. A common design used is the Festo Fin Ray gripper finger design. The Festo Fin Ray gripper uses a flexible, fin-like triangular skeleton with transverse ribs that passively bends around objects, so contact forces redirect into closing forces instead of peeling them away. This geometry gives gentle, adaptive gripping of irregular or fragile parts, high tolerance to misalignment, and simpler actuation/control compared with rigid parallel jaws.

        <h3>3.6 Tool Changers</h3>
        <p>
          As the system will be interacting with various tools, a singular gripper design may be unable to carry or support all types of objects. As a result, the team aims to implement a tool changing system onboard the Cobot to facilitate end-effector changes. Due to the actuation mode being limited to being electric, the team narrowed down 3 concepts that can be explored and evaluated those against metrics.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/toolcc.png"
          subtitle="Fig 4: Subsystems Part 1"></image-component>
        <p>
          Due to the limited space and mass constraints on the system, the Compactness/Weight criterion was weighted highly. Based on the scoring, the Permanent Electromagnet was chosen to be the concept to be explored further.

        <h4>3.7.1 Gripper</h4>
        <p>
          Before analysis can be done, an approximate normal force acting on the gripper jaw was established at 10N based on supporting a load of 15N with rubber contact against metal at a coefficient of friction of 0.69. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To test the Fin Ray design, an inspired gripper was designed and simulated it in SolidWorks via Nonlinear analysis, using TPU-85A as the material. The goal of the analysis was to locate the ideal gripping section that will allow the gripper to wrap around the object.

        <p>
          To test the Rack and Pinion concept with the Fin Ray gripper fingers, I built a 3D-printed prototype using PLA with TPU-85A for the fingers to test the deformation and gripping strength.

          Since this is a prototype, I designed it with parts that facilitate easy swapping of finger geometries to test clamping force. Initial tests showed favourable results in carrying objects up to 900g. Further test will be conducted to validate different gripper profiles and geometries.

        <h4>3.7.2 Tool Changer</h4>
        <p>
          To test the permanent electromagnet concept, calculations were performed on the type of electromagnet used, the corresponding magnetic material to maximise the magnetic attraction between the magnet and electromagnet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The electromagnet use was a permanent electromagnet with a 24V demagnetisation input with 30kg rated strength. For the magnetic material, S275 Ferritic Steel was chosen with 6mm thickness to maximise the magnetic field.
        </p>
        <p>
          Current tests indicate that the magnet can sustain 10kgs of load for a sustained period. Future works into the next semester will focus on creating the tool changer system with the mechanical body and electrical connections.

        <h3>5.2 AMR to Cobot Communication</h3>
        <p>
          To allow the AMR and the Cobot to establish communication, the team decided to use the ROS2 Framework as developing a custom software to fully integrate both systems would be challenging given the closed-source nature of the AMR and Cobot. 
        </p>

          A software container diagram using the C4 model notation was used to show the communication between nodes to create the Robot Software System.

        <p>
          Between the AMR and Cobot, there are several safety features in place to protect the user in the event of a collision. To add on to monitoring these peripherals, the software system will send movement commands only if the AMR is stationary and vice versa. A programmed protective bubble governed by an ellipsoid equation will be activated around the Cobot during operation to ensure incorrect trajectory calculations/movements will be terminated. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-2-header-1">
        <h4>5.3.2 Cobot Trajectory Planner</h4>
        <p>
          For the Cobot to reach a desired position in space, a positional command made of Vectors and Quaternions must be sent to establish both relative position and orientation, which is called a “frame”. To move between 2 frames with a specified trajectory and constraints would require a trajectory planner. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Since developing a planner was not in the scope of the project, the team opted to use planners available in the MoveIt2 Library with ROS2 to fit the Cobot. There are different planners, each with their own advantages. 3 planners were chosen based on the Cobot ROS2 driver compatibility. These are OMPL (Open Motion Planning Library), CHOMP (Covariant Hamiltonian Optimization for Motion Planning) and PILZ (PILZ Industrial Motion Planner). We cross-compared the planners with our use case based on metrics seen in the table below.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/plannerscoring.png"
          subtitle="Figure x: Prototype Gripper Exploded View"></image-component>
        <p>
          For scoring, we scored it from 1 – 3, with 3 being ideal. Due to the conditions that the robot system must interact with, planners with unpredictable behaviour or have probability-based planning were rated lower. Planners with high computational requirement were also rated low. PILZ ended up being the most ideal planner for our use case as it chooses the shortest path while following velocity constraints with high repeatability and predictability.  
        </p>
        <p>
          The planner was defined for use in the test_rv5as.py node such that any input commands will move the robot system accordingly.

        <h3>5.5: Graphical User Interface (GUI)</h3>
        <p>
          Based on Task 3, a user interface is to be created to allow the stakeholders to send requests to the system to perform tasks. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Although both the AMR and Cobot have their own respective GUIs for control, to create a unified robot system would mean a singular user interface that allows for control of both systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our final GUI vision is a single, unified interface that controls both the Cobot and the AMR. Built for staff and makers, it enables task execution without any coding, using clear workflows and teach-by-demonstration tools. A dedicated teaching mode streamlines adding goals and waypoints, making everyday operation fast and intuitive.
